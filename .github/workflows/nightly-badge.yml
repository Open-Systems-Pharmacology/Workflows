name: Nightly Badge
# This workflow acts as a proxy for the nightly build workflow. 
# Upon completion of a nightly build, it is invoked to update a repository badge 
# according to the latest run's result.
#
# Inputs:
#   - nightly-build-workflow (string, required): filename of the nightly workflow to inspect
#     (e.g. build-nightly_12.2.yml). This is the workflow file whose recent run(s) will be
#     queried to determine the badge state.
#
# Behavior summary:
#   1. If the triggering workflow_run's conclusion is 'success' -> this workflow succeeds (badge passing).
#   2. If the triggering workflow_run concluded with a non-cancelled failure (e.g. failure, timed_out)
#      -> this workflow exits with a non-zero status (badge failing).
#   3. If the triggering workflow_run concluded with 'cancelled' -> this workflow will query the
#      GitHub Actions API for the latest non-cancelled run of the specified nightly workflow:
#        - If the latest non-cancelled run's conclusion is 'success', treat the badge as passing.
#        - Otherwise, exit non-zero (badge failing).
